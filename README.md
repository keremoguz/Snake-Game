# Snake Game

I created a snake game in which snake moves with a inital certain speed and when it collects apples, the point increases.

## Game Rules
- Snake's speeds up as it collects points; however, the max speed cannot exceed a certain speed which is defined in the code.
- When Snake collides with the borders or itself, the game finishes.

##  How to play
- You should first run the file.
- After running file, the game will be opened immediately.
- You should just use arrows in your keybord.

## Programming Language and Libraries
- I used Python as a programming language.
- I utilized from tkinter library from Python.
- Used random library for apple's position which should be random.
